## Overview

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple way to keep an eye on several simultaneously running EVE Online clients and to easily switch between them. While running it shows a set of live thumbnails for each of the active EVE Online clients. These thumbnails allow fast switch to the corresponding EVE Online client either using mouse or configurable hotkeys.

It's essentially a task switcher, it does not relay any keyboard/mouse events and suchlike. The application works with EVE, EVE through Steam, or any combination thereof.

The program does NOT (and will NOT ever) do the following things:

* modify EVE Online interface
* display modified EVE Online interface
* broadcast any keyboard or mouse events
* anyhow interact with EVE Online except of bringing its main window to foreground or resizing/minimizing it

**Under any conditions you should NOT use EVE-O Preview for any actions that break EULA or ToS of EVE Online.**

If you have find out that some of the features or their combination of EVE-O Preview might cause actions that can be considered as breaking EULA or ToS of EVE Online you should consider them as a bug and immediately notify the Developer ( Phrynohyas Tig-Rah ) via in-game mail.

## How To Install & Use

1. Download and extract the contents of the .zip archive to a location of your choice (ie: Desktop, CCP folder, etc)
..* **Note**: Please do not install the application into the *Program Files* or *Program files (x86)* folders. These folders in general do not allow applications to write anything there while EVE-O Preview now stores its configuration file next to its executable, thus requiring the write access to the folder it is installed into.
2. Start up both EVE-O Preview and your EVE Clients (the order does not matter)
3. Adjust settings as you see fit. Program options are described below

### Configuration File-Only Options

Some of the application options are not exposed in the GUI. They can be adjusted directly in the configuration file.

**Note:** Do any changes to the configuration file only while the EVE-O Preview itself is closed. Otherwise the changes you made might be lost.

| **PriorityClients** | <div style="font-size: small">Allows to set a list of clients that are not auto-minimized on inactivity even if the **Minimize inactive EVE clients** option is enabled. Listed clients still can be minimized using Windows hotkeys or via _Ctrl+Click_ on the corresponding thumbnail<br />The default value is empty list **[]**<br />For example: **"PriorityClients": [ "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah", "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette" ]**</div> |

### Hotkey Setup

It is possible to set a key combinations to immediately jump to certain EVE window. However currently EVE-O Preview doesn't provide any GUI to set the these hotkeys. It should be done via editing the configuration file directly. Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

**Note**: Don't forget to make a backup copy of the file before editing it.

Open the file using any text editor. find the entry **ClientHotkey**. Most probably it will look like

    "ClientHotkey": {},

This means that no hotkeys are defined. Edit it to be like

    "ClientHotkey": {
      "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah": "F1",
      "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette": "F2"
    }

This simple edit will assign **F1** as a hotkey for Phrynohyas Tig-Rah and **F2** as a hotkey for Ondatra Patrouette, so pressing F1 anywhere in Windows will immediately open EVE client for Phrynohyas Tig-Rah if he is logged on.

The following hotkey is described as `modifier+key` where `modifier` can be **Control**, **Alt**, **Shift**, or their combination. F.e. it is possible to setup the hotkey as

    "ClientHotkey": {
      "EVE - Phrynohyas Tig-Rah": "F1",
      "EVE - Ondatra Patrouette": "Control+Shift+F4"
    }

**Note:** Do not set hotkeys to use the key combinations already used by EVE. It won't work as "_I set hotkey for my DPS char to F1 and when I'll press F1 it will automatically open the DPS char's window and activate guns_". Key combination will be swallowed by EVE-O Preview and NOT retranslated to EVE window. So it will be only "_it will automatically open the DPS char's window_".

### Compatibility Mode

This setting allows to enable an alternate thumbnail render. This render doesn't use advanced DWM API to create live previews. Instead it is a screenshot-based render with the following pros and cons:
* `+`  Should work even in remote desktop environments
* `-`  Consumes significantly more memory. In the testing environment EVE-O Preview did consume around 180 MB to manage 3 thumbnails using this render. At the same time the primary render did consume around 50 MB when run in the same environment.
* `-`  Thumbnail images are refreshed at 1 FPS rate
* `-`  Possible short mouse cursor freezes
